        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>I have spent the last 3 years traveling the country for a mapping startup called Live XYZ. 
            Within three months of being hired as a contractor, I mapped the entire city of Miami by 
            myself and was then promoted to a full-time salaried position. 

            After moving to Headquarters in New York City, I helped interview, hire, train and manage 
            15 employees using a 30-day training program that I developed from scratch. I created various 
            initiatives and experiments on my own time to test new operational methods and to discover 
            ways to improve my teams efficiency, accuracy, and overall performance.
                
            My passion is to help grow an aggressive Startup's operations nationwide. </p>
